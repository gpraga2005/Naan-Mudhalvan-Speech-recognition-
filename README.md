# 🎤 Speech-Based Gender Recognition

This module classifies a speaker's gender (Male/Female) based on their voice using deep learning techniques.

## 🔍 Overview

- Converts audio input to Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
- Classifies the gender using a CNN or LSTM model

## 🧠 Model

- Trained on labeled speech datasets (e.g., TIMIT, Common Voice)
- Uses MFCCs for feature extraction
- Deep learning model: CNN or LSTM

## 🛠 Requirements

```bash
pip install librosa tensorflow numpy pyaudio
▶️ Usage
bash
CopyEdit
python gender_recognition.py
📁 Input
Real-time voice recording

Pre-recorded .wav files

✅ Output
Prints: Predicted Gender: Male or Female

📈 Accuracy
Achieved ~90% accuracy on test dataset.

### 📁 2. Anger Detection via Speech

#### `README.md` (for Anger Detection)

```markdown
# 😠 Anger Detection from Speech

Detects emotional state (with focus on **anger**) from a speaker's voice using speech emotion recognition.

## 🎯 Goal

- Recognize if the speaker is angry in real-time using voice input

## 🔬 Approach

- Extracts features: MFCCs, Chroma, Spectral Contrast
- Trained on datasets like RAVDESS, TESS, or CREMA-D
- Deep learning model: LSTM / GRU-based emotion classifier

## 📦 Dependencies

```bash
pip install librosa keras numpy soundfile
▶️ Usage
bash
CopyEdit
python anger_detection.py
📁 Input
Microphone input or .wav file

✅ Output
Prints: Emotion: Angry or Emotion: Neutral

🔍 Note
Currently focuses on binary classification (Angry / Not Angry)
